Using "Salient Region Detection via High-dimensional Color Transform and Local Spatial Support" that provided us with a reference implemenation found under https://github.com/playerkk/drfi_matlab

I have suggested tweaks from the above implementaion, when done and applied to the "Stanford-dog-walking" image data yeilded better performance. My conclusions we recorded by evaluation metrics created before and after the tweeks. There was no significat loss of information in the salient object per the evalution posted. 

Please note, this was the observation specific to the data set and specific to the evaluation metric as part of a college project 

Seperate readme for both DRFI and HDCT

Using "Salient Region Detection via High-dimensional Color Transform and Local Spatial Support" that provided us with a reference implemenation found under https://github.com/playerkk/drfi_matlab

I have suggested tweaks from the above implementation, when done and applied to the "Stanford-dog-walking" image set yielded significantly higher performance . My conclusions were recorded by evaluation metrics created before and after the tweaks. There was no significant loss of information in the salient object based on the metric used.

Please note, this was the observation specific to the data set and specific to the evaluation metric as part of a college project
